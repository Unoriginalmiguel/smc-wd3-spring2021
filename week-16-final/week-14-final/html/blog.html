                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">You've heard about having big goals. What about becoming the greatest sales person on earth? Well today's guest, Brandon Bornancin has that goal and many more. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Brandon is the CEO and Founder of Seamless.AI, and the author of the new book 'Whatever It Takes: Master the Habits to Transform Your Business, Relationships, and Life' which gives you a glimpse into his journey from 0 to 100 million in recurring revenue.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> He shares some incredible insights from the book with Jeff and Christie. Starting with his no excuses approach, he explains about overcoming limiting beliefs, reframing your thought process, using your difficult experiences as mentors, the importance of ownership and some strategies on boosting your numbers. </p>

                                <h2 class="fw-lighter mb-4 mt-5">How the Quiet and Shy Can Outsell Anyone</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">There’s a popular assumption that selling is an extrovert’s job. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the quiet and more introspective of us can’t excel in the same field. If anything, an introvert’s sense of organization and willingness to practice can be just as effective as persistence and improvising.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In The Introvert’s Edge, life coach and business consultant Matthew Pollard outlines ways to take the same qualities that label someone as “shy” or “quiet” and turn them into personal assets. You can be a compelling storyteller, an empathetic interviewer or a dogged researcher and advocate for your customers.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                When it comes to sales, the most important thing is sincerity. If you’re having trouble with confidence or honing your people skills, this might be a book to add to your reading list this week.</p>

                                <h2 class="fw-lighter mb-4 mt-5">Learn the Secrets of Ninja Selling From an Expert</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Would you say if I told you a book that teaches skills for selling real estate can be applied in all areas of your life? As shocking as that may sound, it’s true.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Kendall developed the Ninja Selling System in response to his own struggles in sales. As a child, he contracted encephalitis, which caused him to walk with a limp. He also stuttered. He survived the encephalitis and stopped stuttering as he got older, but found he still had low self-confidence and self-esteem. After leaving the Army, he ended up in sales, a job he thought he would never be in. Since he wanted to do well in his new job, he sought the advice of mentors and gurus of his day.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                Ninja Selling is an engaging read filled with can-do attitude and inspirational stories to match. While some of the book’s recommendations are specific to real estate, the book has plenty to offer for sales professionals looking to improve. Kendall hones in on the tiny habits, like affirmations or a morning routine, that sales professionals can use immediately to improve their performance on the job. This reinforces Kendall’s point that a successful sales system should fit the personality of the salesperson, not the other way around.</p>
