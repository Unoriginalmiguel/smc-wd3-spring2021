                                    <p class="card-text">A flip turn is the process of changing direction at the wall to stay swimming continuously. For Freestyle and Backstroke this will entail doing a full somersault on the wall and then pushing off in streamline. In Breaststroke and Butterfly, the equivalent is called an ‘Open Turn‘.</p>

In the areas discussed above around breathing technique a change in head position will influence the hips and legs in the water. The higher the head lifts up the lower the hips and kick will generally get.</p>

                                    <p class="card-text">Learning to exhale your air in a relaxed fashion while the head is underwater is very important. Remember you don't have to blow all your air out (you don't do that when you're running or doing other sports). The key is to find a nice rhythm of exhalation and then rolling to the side and simply inhaling. </p>

                    <h2>4 Ways to Improve Your Flip Turns</h2>
                    <h3>Want to slice some time off your swimming without any additional training? (Um, yessss.) Here are 7 tips for how to do an exceptional swim flip turn.</h3>
                </div>
                <hr>
                <p id="first-part">You can produce faster swimming and do a flip turn more efficiently to get better results in the pool with only having to give a little more mental focus over the course of your swimming practices.</p>
                <p class="part">1. Swimmers have a love-hate relationship with the black line at the bottom of the pool. It’s often our only companion during those long swim workouts. Get comfortable swimming into the wall at different speeds–swimming fast, swimming slow, swimming fast with fins–it will improve your ability to properly judge when to commence your flip turn.</p>
                <p class="part">2. When you are approaching the turn think in terms of acceleration—the more speed you carry going into your flip turn the faster you are going to rotate and explode off of the wall. Attack the wall so that you decelerate less and come out of the turn faster. “Besides the start, pushing off the wall is the fastest a swimmer will go during a race,” notes Russell Mark, an actual rocket scientist and high-performance consultant for USA Swimming.</p>
                <p class="part">3. Not breathing into your flip turns does a few powerful things, not the least of which is helps you not slow down into the wall, helps promote better head placement, and even helps teach better breathing pattern discipline. Want a mental cue to help you with this? Think about driving the top of your head straight at the middle of the T on the bulkhead or wall.</p>
                <p class="part">4. When I go into the flip turn I imagine my thighs collapsing onto my stomach as my waist bends forcefully. This simple, but perhaps odd form of visualization keeps my rotation tight and fast and means I don’t need to focus too much on getting the feet over, because it is happening naturally. “When the focus is on getting the heels over, it is not uncommon to see the knees bending too early,” says Mark. He recommends keeping the knees at the surface of the water to cut down on unnecessary resistance.</p>
